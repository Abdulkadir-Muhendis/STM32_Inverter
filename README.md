# STM32 Inverter
## Introduction:

University project: Simple micro-inverter using a STM32F103C8.

## Objectives

Generate 3 phase signal through SPWM with 120 degrees of phase diffence. The frequency, phase and amplitude should be controlled through digital buttons. 

## Project Roadmap

*  [OK] Be able to generate 6 PWM pulses with different duty cycles
*  [OK] Be able to control duty cycles insed timmed interruption routines
*  [--] Guarantee that interruption have the timer and counter well adjusted to required time.
*  [OK] Be able to generate 3 SPWM waves with 120 between them
*  [--] Guarantee that SPWM generated have 120 degrees between them
*  [--] Control SPWM Amplitude
*  [--] Implement GPIO input interruption
...
*  [] Write all steps
